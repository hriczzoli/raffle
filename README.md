## Steps
# Before I got started I wrote a list of steps to follow in order to complete the challenge within the time limit

here's a link to the file: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QiLOtkLmI_lbSczq3iTJbyaS-7LVk48zgyjkwtOqeLE/edit?usp=sharing

Time:

## Issues

    -   After adding an item to the list, when you try to add a new one it fills out the form with the values of the previous one. It should only do that when you edit -> unfortunately I ran out of time so could not fix the issue.
    -   The application also needs proper styling


## Possible additional features

    -   Input field above the list -> to filter
    -   Maybe having predefined filters, or some other type of sorting of sorting (i.e. priority)
        

## Available Scripts

### `yarn install or npm install`
